# PatternInputFormatter Refactoring Completed

## Summary
The PatternInputFormatter has been successfully refactored and fixed to properly support complex patterns like UK postcodes (e.g., RH19KAA), serial numbers, dates, phone numbers, and credit cards.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. Pattern Selection Bug
- **Problem**: Formatter was choosing the wrong pattern for multi-character postcodes/serials
- **Solution**: Implemented a scoring system that prefers patterns matching the most input characters

### 2. Input Mapping Bug
- **Problem**: Input characters weren't properly mapped to pattern placeholders, especially across separators
- **Solution**: Fixed the mapping logic to correctly handle character-to-placeholder correspondence

### 3. Separator Logic Bug
- **Problem**: Separators (spaces, dashes) weren't added at the right time for postal/serial patterns
- **Solution**: Enhanced separator logic to add spaces when transitioning between pattern sections

### 4. Cursor Positioning Bug
- **Problem**: Cursor wasn't positioned correctly after separators were automatically added
- **Solution**: Improved cursor calculation to place cursor after separators when appropriate

## New Architecture

The formatter has been refactored into modular components:

```
lib/
├── pattern_input_formatter.dart              # Main export (backwards compatible)
├── pattern_input_formatter_refactored.dart   # New main implementation
└── src/
    ├── types.dart                           # Enums and data structures
    ├── pattern_detector.dart                # Pattern analysis logic
    ├── pattern_matcher.dart                 # Pattern selection and matching
    ├── formatter_engine.dart                # String formatting and cursor logic
    └── datetime_validator.dart              # Date/time validation
```

## Test Results

All tests pass, including:
- ✅ Original comprehensive test suite (`test/pattern_input_formatter_test.dart`)
- ✅ RH19KAA specific test (`test/rh19kaa_refactored_test.dart`)
- ✅ UK postcode cursor debug test (`test/debug_uk_test.dart`)

## Code Quality

- ✅ No analysis issues in `lib/` folder
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Modular, maintainable code structure
- ✅ Backwards compatible API

## Examples Working

The formatter now correctly handles:

1. **UK Postcodes**: `RH19KAA` formats as `RH19 KAA`
2. **Serial Numbers**: `ABCD1234ef` formats as `ABCD-1234-ef`
3. **Dates**: `25122023` formats as `25/12/2023`
4. **Phone Numbers**: `1234567890` formats as `(123) 456-7890`
5. **Credit Cards**: `1234567890123456` formats as `1234 5678 9012 3456`

## Migration

No changes required for existing users - the public API remains unchanged. The original `pattern_input_formatter.dart` now exports the refactored implementation.
